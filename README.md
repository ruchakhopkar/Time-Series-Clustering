# Time-Series-Clustering
1. This code is used for time series clustering.
2. It uses a metric called DTW or Dynamic Time Warping to compute distances between any 2 time series.
3. Then, a hierarchical clustering is implemented to group all the time series that are similar to each other. 
4. To run, forst run algo.py and then run agglomerative_clustering_final.py
